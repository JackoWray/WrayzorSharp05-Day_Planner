# WrayzorSharp05-Day_Planner

The objective was to create a day planner with the live current day in the header, under which there are timeblocks consistent with a normal working day. The timeblocks have an input for work events, which saves to local storage on the click of it's corresponding button (i.e. remains on timeblock even after refreshing page). The timeslots are also conditionally colour-coded depending on whether they are "past", "present" or "future".
